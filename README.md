# Welcome to your Expo app 

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

This project is a gamified habit tracker where the more habits you complete in a day, the more 
defined your statue becomes. You can watch your statue become more chistled and defined as
you define your habits. 

The concepts, ideas, and user interface were designed by myself. AI was used as a coding assistent to
implement the design concepts. 

The project is mostly complete, but I intend to add a few more features in the future.
I thoroughly enjoy working on this passion project and I hope you enjoy looking at it!
